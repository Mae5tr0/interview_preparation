# Dominos

There is an 8x8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off. 
You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. 
Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board? 
Prove your answer (by providing an example or showing why it's impossible)

## Solution

This is impossible.

When we remove square from opposite corners we remove square with the same color, so after that we have
32 white and 30 black squares (or opposite). One domino cover 1 black and 1 white square so this no way to cover all
squares.
