 * Intersection
 *
 * Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect.
 * Return the intersecting node. Note that the intersection is defined based on reference, not value.
 * That is, if the kth node of the first linked list is the exact same node (by reference)
 * as the jth node of the second linked list, then they are intersecting.
